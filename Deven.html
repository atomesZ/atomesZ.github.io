				    <p> I come from a terminal S-SVT with specialty ISN. This specialty
allowed me to learn Python and in particular to develop my own
game using the PyGame module. The game called Lost Woods was a labyrinth
whose output was indicated by a certain combination of sounds
played by a flute in the center of the labyrinth. These same sounds are listenable
near magical steles arranged at each intersection of the labyrinth.
This year of ISN also allowed me to take in hand several
software such as Audacity as well as developing a number of skills
especially in HTML, PHP and CSS.
It was by going to an EPITA open house that I was
convinced by the good atmosphere of this school responding to my fervent
interest in computing.

			      		<p>I just finished S-SVT specialty
ISN. I discovered programming in high school and since then I've been interested. The specialty ISN allowed me to approach this vast environment.
It was during these classes that I was able to code a naval battle under python.
It made me want to direct my studies towards video games and the
programming by integrating EPITA.</p>

			      	<p>I come from a final grade S-SVT Maths specialty. I love
mathematics and everything related to computers. I discovered
EPITA 2 years ago looking for a path that suits me,
however it is by exchanging with students during a student day
that I wanted to attempt this school. One of them even became my
Godfather ! Apart from computers, I mainly like table tennis,
music and make slides for presentations so that they are the
more beautiful and understandable possible.

					<p>I come from a class of terminale S option S.I, which I carried out at the institution
Our Lady of Sannois, city in which I live. I am passionated
 by new technologies, which is why I chose to join EPITA.
I am very interested in the field of robotic that I particularly like,
and that pushed me to build some montages and small robots
using the arduino platform. I also practice different
sports like tennis or basketball, because in my opinion it is important to
always practice a physical activity.

		<h2>Group creation</h2>
		<h4>Our group was formed by affinity since we were all four in the same class. After much discussion,
we noticed that we had a similar vision of the project and that we wanted to implement this project together.
We decided to name our team REST'art, "REST" being the first letter of each of our first names, "art" representing the art of design and development of video games.
Finally, the whole "REST'art" meaning "restart" in reference to this iconic button video games when the player wants to start a game.
It also highlights the fact that our games will be playable several times without ever getting tired, on the contrary,
restarting a game allows the player to improve and establish a strategy against his opponents and developing a competitive aspect.</h4>
